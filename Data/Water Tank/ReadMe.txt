Water System Netwrok Dataset

This folder includes 14 csv files:

1- location.csv This file includes the location of 100 water tanks. 
The headers in this file are x and y, where (x,y) in row i represents the location of tank i.

2- connection_matrix_inverse_distance.csv This file represents the connection between the tanks. 
When there is no pipe between tank j and k, (j,k) value is zero. 
When there is a pipe between the tanks, (j,k) value is proportional to the inverse length of the pipe; shorter the pipe, larger the connection.

3- measurements_1.csv to measurements_12.csv These files represent tanks time series measurements. 
The first column in the files represents time. Each tank has three variables:

    Tank Pressurei is the pressure of tank i. This value can be between 0 and 100.
    Tanki Refill is a binary variable. Tanki Refill=1 when tank i is in the refill mode and Tanki Refill=0 otherwise.
    Tanki Leak is a binary variable. Tanki Leak=1 when tank i is leaking, and Tanki Leak=0 when there is no leak in the tank. Therefore, the total number of variables in these files is 301.
